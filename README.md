### ➤ Course History

| No. | Target Grade | Subject | Syllabus |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :- |
| 1 | 2-1 | 자료구조 | This course covers the essential data structures that students must know as undergraduate students including arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, heaps, B tree, time complexity, and so on. In addition, this course will also cover key sorting algorithms along with time and space complexity. Not only focus on theoretical topics, but it will also strongly emphasize practical abilities in programming using data structures. All data structures are explained in C programming language. Labs and assignments should be done with the GCC compiler (GNU C compiler). Therefore, students must have basic experience with C. Note that this course includes a Coding Test. |
| 2 | 2-1 | 객체지향 프로그래밍 | This course develops object programming skills through theoretical learning and practice of C++, an object-oriented programming language. |
| 3 | 2-2 | 오픈소스개발프로젝트 | The course is a project course to learn Java language and conduct projects in Java over the semester. It deals with open-source tools like Github and Stackoverflow and the tools are used in project management and troubleshooting. |
| 4 | 2-2 | 컴퓨터그래픽스 | This course covers the theory and practice of basic topics such as geometric modeling, rendering, and animation that make up the field of computer graphics. Students will learn graphics programming techniques using OpenGL, a popular real-time three-dimensional graphics open-source software. |
| 5 | 3-1 | 객체지향 설계 | This course aims to learn object-oriented analysis, design, and implementation methodologies. Students will learn and be trained on how to conduct software requirements specification, software design description, and source code implementation, as well as produce software requirements specification(SRS), software design description(SDD), and source code systematically. |
| 6 | 3-1 | AI  오픈소스 전문프로젝트 | This course will mainly be about an understanding of the Android Framework and the programming of an Android App using Java language.
It is to learn by practice using examples of required various design techniques for Android App development, and so implement for App projects.
Project-related source code is managed on GitHub. The program must consider the secure coding method. |
| 7 | 3-2 | 데이터베이스시스템 | This course covers the fundamental concepts of database systems. Topics include relation models, query languages (SQL and stored procedures), data modeling (Entity-Relationship diagram), and database optimization techniques (normalization, index structures, and views). The course also discusses the emerging trends in database technologies, such as big data, data analytics, and NoSQL databases. In the end, there will be a series of special lectures from well-known industry experts in the field of the database (SAP HANA, Oracle Korea). |
| 8 | 3-2 | 펌웨어프로그래밍 | This course introduces the core concepts of Arduino and its application in IoT. Learn about Arduino's architecture, its microprocessor, and how to program it for various applications. Gain hands-on experience integrating electronic components and connecting Arduino projects to the internet. The curriculum will wrap up with insights from industry experts on emerging trends in Arduino and IoT. |
| 9 | 3-2 | 소프트웨어공학 | This course applies the knowledge and theoretical understanding gained through computer science to building high-quality software products. |
