### ➤ Course History

| No. | Target Grade | Subject | Syllabus |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :- |
| 1 | 2-2 | 오픈소스개발프로젝트 | The course is a project course to learn Java language and conduct projects in Java over the semester. It deals with the open source tools like Github and Stackoverflow and the tools are used in the project management and troubleshooting. |
| 2 | 2-2 | 컴퓨터그래픽스 | This course covers the theory and practice of basic topics such as geometric modeling, rendering, and animation that make up the field of computer graphics. Students will learn graphics programming techniques using OpenGL, a popular real-time three-dimensional graphics open-source software. |
| 3 | 2-1 | 자료구조 | This course covers the essential data structures that students must know as undergraduate students including arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, heaps, B tree, time complexity, and so on. In addition, this course will also cover key sorting algorithms along with time and space complexity. Not only focusing on theoretical topics, but it will also strongly emphasize on practical abilities on programming using data structures. All data structures are explained in C programming language. Labs and assignments should be done with GCC compiler (GNU C compiler). Therefore, students must have basic experiences on C. Note that this course includes **Coding Test**. |
| 4 | 2-1 | 객체지향 프로그래밍 | This course develop object programming skills through theoretical learning and practice of C++, an object-oriented programming language. |
| 5 | 3-1 | 객체지향 설계 | This course aims to learn object-oriented analysis, design, and implementation methodologies. Students will learn and be trained on how to conduct software requirements specification, software design description, and source code implementation, as well as can produce software requirements specification(SRS), software design description(SDD), and source code systematically. |
